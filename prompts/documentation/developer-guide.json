This is crucial when managing a large number of documents efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented a scoring system on the Search page to improve the relevance of search results. By prioritizing words that appear frequently in documents, users can find relevant information more easily.\n\nSecurity is a top priority. To protect access to the Insert/Update Page, we integrated Google OAuth authentication. This ensures that only authorized users from our organization can access sensitive features, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.\n\nFurthermore, our tool supports documents in various formats, which are standardized into consistent chunks. This simplifies processing and indexing, making the system more efficient overall.\n\nBatch processing capabilities have been added to streamline document insertion, particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of documents. This feature optimizes performance by efficiently managing the insertion process.\n\nWe've also enhanced search capabilities by indexing specific fields within documents, enabling advanced filtering options. This improves the search experience by helping users quickly locate desired information.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, we distinguish between public and private documents. Public documents are accessible to all users, while private documents are restricted to authorized personnel within our organization.\n\nMoreover, our tool seamlessly integrates with Google Drive and GitHub, adapting to different document hosting environments. This ensures maximum accessibility and usability across platforms.",

First, the Document Searcher, who utilizes the search function to access specific document sections via a user-friendly interface and a public API. Second, the Document Manager, who, after logging in with Google credentials, accesses a dedicated page within the Flask application. Here, they interact with a table displaying documents and checkboxes for actions like updating or deleting selected documents. Additionally, a search bar facilitates easy location of specific document titles. Users can also add Google Drive folders or insert new documents via modal panes with form submissions.",
